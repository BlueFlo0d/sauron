* sauron

  *WARNING* *HUOM* sauron is in its early stages of development (basicly, one
   evening of hacking. It's not ready for general consumption.

** but what is it?

  sauron is an emacs mode for keeping track of what goes on in the world
  behind you. Modern desktop environments have all kinds of fancy widgets
  etc. that steal my attention (or sometimes not enough), so I figured it's
  better to have emacs give me buffer which list all the important events.

  What kind of events? Well, sauron started because during my work, I need to
  track a lot of IRC channels. I'm using [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC][ERC]] as my IRC-client, and it's not
  always totally obvious is someone 'pinged' me in some channel. It provides a
  number of hooks, but I wasn't able to make them behave the way I like --
  that is, give me a short description of what's happening, and teleport me to
  the channel in question at the click of a button (later I found, ERC may
  actually have some built-ins capable of that, but alas...)

  So, I started writing Sauron as the Ã¼ber hook function to deal with ERC
  channel, when it occured to me that I could actually do it a bit more
  general -- say, warn me of new e-mails, if a torrent has completed, and so
  on.

  Needless to say (but I do it anyway), there is a fine balance between
  getting the useful messages and /spam/, and that balance differs from person
  to person.
